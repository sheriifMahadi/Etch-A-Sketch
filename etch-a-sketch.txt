First create a 16x16 grid using flexbox. The div should be created using JavaScript. Put them in a container div. 

Put a hover effect on the grid divs so when a mouse passes it has a pixelated effect. Use event listeners and change the color  into something random using javaScript. 

Put a button that says "Grid", this button produces a pop up and asks for number of grid to create, 99 is the limit. Also maybe be able to update the pixels without changing anything.

Give an option to pass an RGB value or plain black. Pixels are initially white.
